								Hello! I'm Aura, and I'm a junior double majoring in Computer Science and IMGD Tech. I hope to go to graduate school in London after graduating from WPI. I really enjoy cats, knitting, and singing.  I never thought I'd become a part of Greek life but I'm really happy that I found Alpha Gam. Alpha Gam has helped me develop confidence in my leadership skills and has introduced me to lifelong friends.
